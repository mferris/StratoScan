// ---- Curve resolution ------------------------------------------------
// $fa/$fs rather than a fixed $fn. A fixed count makes the flats grow with
// the feature, so the biggest, most looked-at surfaces come out roughest: at
// $fn=96 this shell's 223mm rim carried 7.3mm flats and the cradle 8.2mm,
// while every 3mm screw hole also got 96 sides it had no use for. $fs caps
// the chord -- the width of one flat, which is what the eye reads as
// faceting -- so a big curve gets the facets and a small hole does not.
//
// This is the one design here that has actually been printed, so the small
// fit-critical features keep their own explicit $fn below and are untouched.
// What changes is the geometry without an explicit setting, and the four
// wide arcs. The effect on a 3.4mm clearance hole is 0.02mm on diameter --
// two hundredths, against a printer tolerance an order of magnitude larger.
