# Kitten enclosure — two-tone

The round display as a cat's face, in two colours: black stand, **white paws
with black toes**, and a **black tail with a white tip**. Ears, whisker-dot
speaker grilles, a nose on the bezel, and a stand with paws and a curled
tail.

![two-tone stand](two-tone-preview.png)

Every dimension that touches a physical part comes verbatim from the
[Retro Radar Enclosure](../Retro%20Radar%20Enclosure/), which is printed and
validated: the 203.34mm round panel, the Pi's 58×49 standoff pattern, the two
100×45mm speakers, the 30mm fan, the M3 screw ring, the USB-C and SMA
bulkheads. Only the shape is new, so the two cases are interchangeable on the
same hardware.

This began as a fork of a single-colour kitten design, which has since been
removed — the paws and tail here are about 15% larger than they were in it,
because at two colours they stop being a silhouette detail and become the
thing the eye lands on. `stand.stl` is the whole stand as one piece if you
want it in a single filament.

## Parts

The head is one colour and prints as before:

| part | colour | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| `shell` | black | the head — body cylinder plus two ears, and all the internals |
| `front_trim` | black | the face — bezel ring with a nose, whisker grooves and seven screw holes |
| `retainer` | — | ring behind the glass (identical to the retro part) |
| `back_plate` | black | removable back — locating lip, vents, one USB-C pass-through, the antenna mount's bolt holes and cable hole |
| `antenna_mount` | black | bolt-on arm carrying the antenna socket |
| `antenna_mount_sma` | alternative mount: same flange, arm and counter-tilt, ending in a panel-mount SMA jack instead of a socket cut for one antenna's base |
| `antenna_mount_twin` | **the one to print for the FlyCatcher:** same flange and three bolts, ending in a crossbar with two SMA jacks 80 mm apart, for the 1090 and 978 MHz whips; counter-tilted so both stand vertical with their hinges straight. Two parts: this body, and the cover below |
| `antenna_mount_twin_cover` | the 3 mm cover that closes the twin body's cable channel, on five M2 screws (`twin_assembled` shows both on the plate, for pictures only) |
| `usbc_gauge` | — | test coupon: five candidate USB-C cutouts, to fit the connector before printing a plate |

The stand is split into five bodies, one per colour region:

| part | colour | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| `stand_body` | **black** | plinth, cradle arms, keel |
| `stand_paws` | **white** | both foot pads |
| `stand_toes` | **black** | the eight toe lobes |
| `stand_claws` | **white** | eight real claws, one per toe |

`kitten-stand-twotone.3mf` is all six of the above in one project file with
the filaments already assigned — the easiest way in, and the one that avoids
the multi-lump selection problem described under *Printing it in two colours*.
| `stand_tail` | **black** | the tail from root to the white tip |
| `stand_tail_tip` | **white** | the flicked-up end |

`stand` is the whole stand as one piece, the same shape in a single
filament — useful if you are not printing in two colours, and it is also the
reference the five coloured parts are checked against.

## The back comes off, and carries the antenna

The back used to be a fixed floor with the electronics standing on it, so the
only way in was through the glass. It is a separate plate now, screwed to
eight insert posts exactly as the faceplate is.

**This plate is the same part as the retro build's**, and so is the antenna
mount. Both cases are the same 223.34mm diameter, use the same eight-post
ring, and lean back by the same 18°. That is checked rather than asserted:
exported from each design, the two back plates are 15,410 facets that compare
equal as sets — the same solid, differing only in triangle order.

A rib on the inner face drops into the bore so the plate lands centred and
square and holds itself there while the screws go in, with a 1.2mm chamfer on
its outer top edge so it finds its own centre. It is eight arcs rather than a
ring: the insert posts span r=102.2–111.2 against a bore wall at
r=108.7–111.7, so they straddle the wall and a continuous ring would run
through all eight. Three checks hold it — `lip_present` as a positive
control, `lip_clears_posts`, and `lip_inside_bore`, since a lip larger than
the bore does not locate anything, it just stops the plate seating.

The two cable glands are gone, replaced by a single opening for a panel-mount
USB-C cable; the antenna's coax comes in through the mount's own bore
instead. **The cutout has been fitted to the real
connector** (2026-09-29): it fits, its two M3 mounting screws are 16.5mm
apart, and the holes are M3 clearance. For a different connector, print
`usbc_gauge`, a coupon carrying the cutout plus four neighbours at ±0.5 and
±1.0mm, and fit it before committing a plate.

The mount screws into three M3 heat-set inserts on the plate's inner face
rather than through bare holes, so it can be removed without holding a nut
inside the case. The insert pocket stops on a shoulder 1mm above the plate so
the insert cannot be pressed too deep. The bolt circle is clocked 30° off
vertical for clearance, not looks: at 0° one boss reaches y=106.5, into the
locating lip at 106.3.

The upper vent moved from y=+68 to y=−68. The mount's flange is a 40mm disc
centred at y=88 (y=81 since 2026-10-07), so at +68 the grille sat underneath it from y=68 to y=81,
venting into the back of a solid disc — which is what prompted this.
`vents_clear_of_mount` holds the new position, and `vents_were_under_mount`
is its paired control, finding the 257mm³ overlap the old one had.

The Pi is mounted to the LCD panel, so taking the plate off exposes the back
of the Pi and its cabling rather than removing it. The four 58×49 Pi
standoffs the plate used to carry were never used and are gone (2026-10-07;
`pi_posts()` keeps their geometry). **There is no fan mount** — the fan goes on the Pi. The two grille
patterns stay as plain vents.

The antenna mounts on the back of the plate rather than on a turret, since a
turret out of a cat's skull is a spike. It is a **bolt-on**: three M3 bolts
on a 30mm circle. That keeps both parts flat and support-free on the bed, and
lets the antenna angle change later without reprinting the tray. The cable
drops out of the socket and runs straight through the arm, the flange and the
plate into the case.

The mount sits inside the head's outline and cannot be seen from the front;
only the antenna shows, rising between the ears.

### Why the arm reaches straight back before the barrel rises

The arm goes **back** from the plate, and only then does a barrel rise from
its end along the antenna's own axis. That two-stage shape is forced, not
styled. A barrel coaxial with the antenna and rooted on the plate would have
to climb toward the head the whole way and would run into it.

The first attempt avoided that by hulling a pad on the plate to a disc at the
socket — which produced a *cone* with the socket bored into its flank, so the
antenna pointed sideways and down rather than up. A stub plus a barrel gives
a real cylindrical socket with a flat face square to the antenna.

The arm is 30mm because that is what the clearance costs. Swept against the
antenna's own envelope: at 22mm it fouls the head's top rim even at nominal
diameter, at 26mm it clears nominal but not +2mm, and at 30mm it still clears
with 6mm of radial slack. `antenna_clears_head` holds it.

## The plate fits one way only

The plate's locating rib is eight identical arcs between eight evenly
spaced posts, so it used to seat at any of eight positions 45° apart, and
only one of them puts the antenna mount at the top. A small block on the
shell's bore wall at 247.5° (lower left, between the posts at 225° and 270°)
now meets a matching notch in one arc of the rib: upright, the plate drops
in; turned to any other position, the block lands on the rib and the plate
stands proud before a screw goes in. It sits well clear of the antenna-mount
bosses at the top and the USB-C window, and both shells put it at the same
angle, so the one plate still fits both cases.

`key_fits` proves the upright plate meets the block with no volume, and
`key_blocks_45` … `key_blocks_315` prove each of the other seven positions
collides (43.7 mm³ each), each as its own check, because a key that blocked
only some angles would still let the plate in wrong.

## Printing it in two colours

The five stand bodies share one coordinate frame, so they occupy their true
positions relative to each other. That gives you two routes:

**Multi-material (AMS, MMU, tool changer).** Open
`kitten-stand-twotone.3mf`. It is the whole stand as one object with the six
bodies already inside it and a filament already assigned to each — nothing to
position, nothing to select.

That file exists because loading the STLs separately does not work well, for
a reason that is not obvious. Three of the bodies are physically several
disconnected lumps: two paws, two clumps of toes, and eight separate claws,
because that is what the shapes are. Slicers split a multi-lump mesh into
separate parts on import, so picking a filament for "the claws" colours **one
claw** and leaves the other seven — which looks like the tool ignoring you.
There is no way to fix that from the STL side; eight claws cannot be one
connected lump. So the assignment lives in the project file instead.

The filament slots are 1 for the black (body, toes, tail), 2 for the white
(paws, tail tip) and 3 for the claws, kept on their own slot so they can be a
third colour. Change any of them in the slicer.

If you would rather load the STLs by hand anyway: load the first, then "add
part"/"load as part" for the rest, which preserves their positions, and
assign a filament to each.
No supports needed for the paws or toes; the tail tip lifts off the paw and
wants a little support under the flick.

**Single extruder.** Print them as separate objects and glue. Every split
follows a real seam in the shape — pad to toe, tail to tip — so the joins
land where the eye already expects a line. Print `stand_body` flat on its
base; the paws, toes and tail parts are all small and sit stably on their cut
faces.

### Why the parts overlap slightly

The bodies deliberately interfere by 0.3mm (`colour_overlap`) along every
seam, and the first version of this design got that exactly backwards.

Cutting each part with the precise shape of its neighbour is the tidy answer
and it is the broken one. It produces a perfect partition — zero shared
volume — while leaving the two bodies sharing a *surface* at identical
coordinates. No renderer can decide which of two faces at the same depth is
in front, so the slicer stipples the seam with the other colour: a white paw
arrives speckled black, worst over the buried half of the paw where the
shared area is largest.

So each part is cut with a slightly inset copy of whatever takes precedence
over it, leaving a thin shell of shared material instead of a shared surface.
Nothing is coplanar, and the colour boundary moves by at most 0.15mm — a
fifth of a nozzle width, so which body a slicer awards the shell to cannot be
seen in the print.

The tail needed the opposite treatment. Its two parts are runs of the same
tapering tube, so wherever they overlap they carry the same outer skin —
and an overlap of identical skin is the very coincidence being avoided.
There the tip is grown rather than the body shrunk, so over the shared
stretch the white tip sits 0.15mm proud of the black tail it continues.

## The whisker grooves

Three short arcs engraved into the bezel face either side of the nose.

They were briefly in the wrong place, and it is worth recording how. The
nose sits at −y, the bottom of the face; the grooves were rotated about 0°
instead — the right-hand side — so all six landed 90° from the nose they
were meant to flank. That printed before anyone noticed, as six unexplained
indentations down one side of a faceplate.

They are now placed off `nose_angle` rather than a literal, and each sweeps
away from the nose so the two sides mirror. `whisker_off_nose` in
`checks.scad` pins it: the grooves must lie entirely within a 90° wedge
centred on where `nose()` actually puts itself. That wedge is written as a
literal 270 on purpose — deriving it from `nose_angle` would make the check
vacuous, since moving the angle would move the wedge along with the grooves.

## Where the colour goes, and why

- **Paws white, toes black.** The toes are the detail that makes a paw read
  as a paw, and they are small — they need the contrast more than the pad
  does. The clefts between them grew with the toes; the groove is the only
  thing making four toes read as four rather than one lumpy pad.
- **Claws are their own body, and they are real geometry.** The grooves
  between the toes were being read as the nails; they were never that — they
  are the only thing making four toes read as four. There are now eight
  actual claws, one off the front of each toe, following that toe's splay and
  drooping toward the desk the way a cat's does. Their base sits *inside* the
  toe rather than butted against it: a spike joined at a tangent point is a
  weak spot in the print, and a butted joint would share a surface with the
  toe, which is the coincidence that stipples the preview. The tip stops
  clear of the desk on purpose — claws that reached z=0 would carry the
  stand's weight on eight little points and rock, which `claws_off_the_desk`
  holds. `claws_stand_proud` is the paired positive control: a claw entirely
  buried in its toe passes every seam and volume check while being invisible
  on the print, which is exactly what the grooves-as-nails problem looked
  like.
- **Tail black, tip white, and the tip lifts.** The first version had the tip
  resting flat on the pad, which is what a sitting cat does — but that put a
  white tip on top of a white paw, where it vanished. The whole point of a
  white tip is that it reads against what surrounds it. Lifted, it is
  silhouetted from every angle, and a flicked tail tip is cat-like anyway.
  This was caught by rendering it and looking, not by any check.

## Smoothness

Curve resolution is set by `$fs` (0.4mm) and `$fa` (0.5°) in the `.scad`,
not by a fixed facet count.

A fixed count was what this had, and it makes the flats grow with the
feature — so the biggest, most looked-at surfaces come out roughest. At the
old `$fn = 96` the head's 223mm rim carried **7.3mm flats** and the cradle
8.2mm, while every 3mm screw hole also got 96 sides it had no use for. `$fs`
caps the chord — the width of one flat, which is what the eye reads as
faceting — so a large curve gets the facets and a small hole does not. The
head is now at 0.97mm and every sphere in the paws, toes and tail at 0.4mm,
which is one extrusion width: below that a 0.4mm nozzle cannot reproduce the
difference.

The meshes are exported as **binary STL**. At this resolution the stand is
173,000 facets, which is 52MB as ascii and 8.3MB as binary for byte-identical
geometry. Every slicer reads both.

`tail_smooth_steps` is the other half of it. The tail is hulls between
consecutive spheres, so every sphere leaves a crease running around the
tube. At the old resolution those creases were masked by the general
faceting; once the circumference was smooth they read as rings. 14 points
per control segment puts a joint every 2.4mm instead of 5.6mm, for about a
megabyte.

To go finer, lower `$fs` — but check the file sizes, because sphere cost
grows as the square.

**`use <>` does not carry `$fa`/`$fs`.** It imports modules and functions
only, so `checks.scad` and the preview files set them again at the top. Miss
that and they silently render at OpenSCAD's defaults, showing a faceting the
exported mesh does not have — or, worse, validating geometry that is not what
gets printed.

## Seven screws, not eight

The bezel has seven screw holes. There is an eighth insert post in the shell
at the same angle as the nose, and the nose stands on top of it — 2.6mm of
solid capping the hole, so that screw could never have been fitted. Rather
than leave a hole that cannot take a screw and reads as a moulding defect
under the chin, it is not cut at all.

The shell keeps all eight posts. An unused boss is invisible from outside and
keeps that part identical to the retro build it was copied from.

Found by probing the screw ring after a faceplate had already been printed.
`nose_screw_removed` now proves the hole is absent, and `other_screws_present`
is its paired positive control — an empty result from the first would also be
what a probe in the wrong place produces, so a probe at a normal position has
to find a real hole for the pair to mean anything.

## Heat-set inserts

Every screw that gets undone goes into a brass M3 heat-set insert. The holes are sized for the Kadrick M2–M5 kit: its M3 inserts are 4.5 mm across the knurl and 3.9 mm at the lead-in. Every insert hole is **4.0 mm**, so the lead-in drops in square and the knurl melts 0.25 mm a side into the plastic. (They were 4.2, which left a 4.5 mm insert only 0.15 mm of bite.)

| Where | Count | Insert | Screw | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Front posts in the shell (front trim and retainer screw into these) | 8 posts, 7 used | M3 × 5 | M3 × 14 | Pressed from the front, flush with the shelf the retainer sits on |
| Back posts in the shell (back plate screws into these) | 8 | M3 × 6 | M3 × 8 | Pressed from the back face, flush |
| Antenna mount flange | 3 | M3 × 5 | M3 × 8 | The pocket is in the mount; the screws come from inside the case, through the back plate |
| Twin antenna mount's cover | 5 | M2 × 3 | M2 × 6 | 3.0 mm holes in the cover seat (for a 3.2 mm knurl; 3.2 if the kit's inserts are the 3.5 mm kind — measure them). No counterbores: a 3 mm cover printed face-down can't roof them, so the cap heads stand 2 mm proud of a face nothing touches |
| Speaker bosses (optional) | 8 | M2 × 3 | M2 × 6 | The 2.6 mm pilot takes the speaker's self-tapping screws; drill it to 3.0 for an M2 insert |

**The front posts are new.** They used to be only 2 mm tall: an insert sat in 2 mm of plastic with open air under it and the wall on one side only (measured: a third of the ring round it was solid). Now each post hangs 8 mm below the shelf, merged into the wall, with a 45° cone under it so it prints without support. The holes are cut after the whole shell is unioned, so the speaker brackets at 0° and 180° can't fill them.

- `front_inserts_surrounded` proves every front insert has a 1.75 mm ring of plastic all round it for its full length. Run against the old shell, it finds 545 mm³ missing.
- `front_insert_holes_open` is its positive control.

The kitten's bezel has seven screws (see *Seven screws, not eight*). The post under the nose needs no insert.

**Pressing them:** a soldering iron with an M3 insert tip, at about 220 °C for PLA or 245 °C for PETG.
1. Start the insert square in the hole.
2. Let it sink under its own weight plus light pressure. Don't push hard.
3. Stop when it is flush.
4. Hold a flat, cool piece of metal on it for a few seconds while the plastic sets, so it stays square.

### The twin mount: 1090 and 978 MHz

The FlyCatcher has two antenna inputs, 1090 and 978 MHz, and the Nooelec bundle has a hinged whip for each. `antenna_mount_twin` holds both.
- **Same base as the others:** the flange and three bolts, so nothing else changes.
- **A crossbar** with a bulkhead jack at each end, 80 mm apart. Antennas this close in frequency detune each other when bunched together.
- **Counter-tilted,** like the single mounts, so the whips stand vertical with their hinges straight. Hinges hold firmly only at their stops, and part-way they sag over time.

**Cables:** two SMA male to SMA female bulkhead jumpers, RG316, about 30 cm (SMA, not RP-SMA): a bulkhead end has a threaded barrel with a nut and washer, which is what holds the antenna. The small right-angle pigtails in the antenna bundle are MCX, for Nooelec's USB sticks, and aren't used.

**Whip or external antenna, the user's choice:** each tower's jack is an ordinary SMA socket on the outside of the case. Screw on the Nooelec whip, or the coax from an antenna mounted outside or in a window; nothing inside changes. An outdoor antenna with an N-type connector needs an N-male to SMA-male cable. Leave the FlyCatcher's bias-tee switch off unless the outdoor antenna has a powered amplifier that needs it.

**Two parts since 2026-10-07: a body and a flat cover.** The first version ran each cable through an internal tunnel and could not be assembled: both ends of a jumper are rigid metal about 9 mm across and 15–20 mm long, and that cannot turn a right-angle corner inside an 11 mm bore. The checks had only ever passed a straight probe down each leg. Now the crossbar and towers have an open channel on the side away from the case, closed by a cover on five M2 screws, so everything is laid in and nothing is threaded round a corner. The arm's bore runs straight on through the crossbar and out of the channel floor; it is 13 mm, and so is the plate's hole, because both plugs share it and the second has to pass the first cable. Under each tower's panel is a slot that is a close fit on the jack's hex body, so the jack cannot turn while its nut is tightened. The panel is 2 mm: the bulkhead's thread is 10 mm from its shoulder, and 2 of panel, 0.6 of washer and 2.5 of nut leave 4.9 mm for the whip's own coupling nut.

**The plate's cable hole grew from 11 to 13 mm the same day.** A back plate printed before that — including one printed from the y=81 plate committed earlier on 2026-10-07 — will not pass the second plug and must be reprinted.

**Before printing, measure the jumper's bulkhead end behind the shoulder:** across the flats, and whether it is a hex at all. The slot is cut for an 8 mm hex (`ant_twin_jack_af`; slot = flats + 0.8, floor so the hex's corners put the barrel under the hole). A 7 or 9 mm hex needs that number changed; a round body has nothing for the slot to hold, and the jack is then held with thin pliers through the open channel while its nut goes on, before the cover.

**Printing:** body flange-down with tree supports (Bambu Support for ABS interface), as the other mounts print. The channel, slots, insert holes and jack holes all face up or sideways and need nothing; the towers' outboard ends and the bar's top edge start in mid-air, so the supports go on the face toward the case, where nobody sees the scars. Cover flat, counterbored face down, no support. ASA on a clean Engineering plate, no glue.

**Fitting the cables** (cover off, body held channel-up — or the flange hanging over the bench edge, since the plugs come out of its underside):
1. Push each plug end into the bore at the centre of the channel, straight down the arm and out through the flange — the second plug goes in beside the first cable with a wiggle. Leave about 10 cm of each cable beyond the bore's mouth.
2. Lay one cable along the channel to each tower. Hold the jack's hex body with the barrel pointing up its tower and slide it sideways into the open slot until it stops.
3. Push the jack up with a fingertip through the open channel: the top of the slot is a closed pocket the hex's size, and the barrel comes through the panel when the body is in it. Washer and nut on from the top, finger tight, then a quarter turn with an 8 mm (5/16") spanner — the pocket holds the jack, so nothing inside has to be held. Don't crank it; the panel is 2 mm of ASA. Check the nuts again after a week; ASA relaxes a little.
   Set each whip so its hinge folds towards or away from the wall, not towards the other whip: that's the direction the mount is weakest, so the hinge gives before the panel does, and a folded whip then clears the other tower.
4. Tidy the cables into the channel and fit the cover: five M2 × 6 into the M2 inserts.
5. Pass both plugs through the plate's 13 mm hole, bolt the flange on from inside the plate with the three M3 × 8, plug 1090 and 978 into the FlyCatcher, and screw the whips on (the 1090 whip is the shorter one). For an outdoor antenna, screw its coax onto the same barrel instead, and give the coax its own strain relief within a few centimetres of the tower.

To replace a cable: back plate off, cover off, nut off, slide the jack out of its slot, pull the plug back up through the bore. The mount stays bolted to the plate.

**Checks:**
- `twin_bore_straight`: a plug beside a cable (12 mm) passes straight down the 13 mm bore from the flange face to below the crossbar.
- `twin_slot_takes_jack`: an 8 mm-across-flats hex body stands in each slot under its panel.
- `twin_cover_fits`: the cover sits in its seat without touching the body; `twin_cover_seats` (control) finds the body when the cover is pushed 2 mm in. `twin_channel_open` and `twin_cover_screws_open` (controls) find a rod along the channel and rods through the cover's holes whole, and `twin_channel_probe_clear` and `twin_screw_probes_clear` are their complements: the same rods meet no body at all.
- `top_screw_clear_of_twin`: the plate's top screw and a hex key clear the mount.
- `twin_antennas_clear_case`: both whips, swept 220 mm up, miss the case (and the kitten's ears); `twin_antennas_probe_works` (control): the same envelopes moved 60 mm down the axis and 40 mm toward the case do hit it.
- `twin_vs_plate`, `twin_vs_stand`: no collisions with the back plate or the stand.
- `twin_panels_present`, `twin_holes_open`: positive controls; the panels are there and the jack holes are open.

## Checks

`sh run-checks.sh` runs every target in `checks.scad` and reports the
**volume** each produces.

Volume, not facet count. A boolean between parts that touch leaves
zero-thickness films along the boundary — thousands of facets and no volume —
so counting facets calls a correct model broken. The threshold is 1mm³
against a paw of roughly 27,000mm³, and a real interference has nowhere to
hide in that gap.

Volume alone is not enough either, which is what the speckled first version
proved: a shared surface has no volume at all. That is what
`check-coincident.py` below is for.

Alongside the fit checks on the head and cradle, the colour split adds:

- `material_lost` — must be **zero**: a region of the one-piece stand that no
  coloured part claims. That would print as a hole.
- `material_gained`, `paws_vs_toes`, `body_vs_paws`, `tail_vs_tip` — must be
  **small but non-zero**: these are the colour seams, and zero here means the
  parts share surfaces instead of overlapping, which is the speckling bug.
  Bounded at 1500mm³, which is 0.15mm of thickness over 10,000mm² of shared
  surface — far more than these parts have.
- `canary` — must produce geometry. Without it, a typo in the `use <>` path
  makes every check above pass against nothing, which has happened here
  before.

`check-coincident.py` makes the check the volume tests cannot: it compares
the exported meshes face by face and counts triangles two parts have at
identical coordinates. Two parts sharing a surface have zero shared volume
and still stipple, so nothing about that bug is visible in a volume
measurement. All ten pairs must come out at zero. With the overlap disabled
(`-D colour_overlap=0`) the same check reports 3,502 shared faces between the
paws and the toes, which is precisely the speckling.

Run everything with `sh run-checks.sh`, which also runs the coincidence
check.

## Regenerating

```sh
for p in shell front_trim retainer stand back_plate usbc_gauge \
           antenna_mount antenna_mount_sma antenna_mount_twin antenna_mount_twin_cover \
           stand_body stand_paws stand_toes stand_claws stand_tail stand_tail_tip; do
  openscad --backend=manifold --export-format binstl \
           -D "part=\"$p\"" -o "$p.stl" kitten-enclosure-twotone.scad
done
```

**The exporter is not deterministic.** Two consecutive exports of unchanged
source differ — 135 facets out of 210,448 on the stand, and even the facet
count moves (210,758 vs 210,448 across runs). It shows up on the stand and
not on the simple parts, which is consistent with it coming from the hundreds
of hulls the paws and tail are built from. Two consequences: re-exporting
everything makes the stand files show as modified whether or not anything
changed, so only re-export what actually changed; and comparing two STLs byte
for byte is not a test of whether they are the same shape — compare the
triangle sets instead.

The `.stl` files are committed alongside the source so the folder is
self-contained, but they are generated. Change the `.scad` and both must be
re-exported and committed together, or the mesh quietly stops matching the
source it claims to come from.

### The connector has to fit through, not just the cable

The bore was 9mm and the coax **connector** is 9.15mm across its widest
point, so it did not pass at all. Worse, the straight bore is cut along the
plate's normal while the socket above it is tilted by `stand_angle`, so the
two were not coaxial and the socket floor met the bore at an angle — leaving
a shoulder across the opening for the antenna's base to land on. Widening the
bore alone would not have removed that; it is a consequence of the two axes
disagreeing.

The socket floor is now opened square to the **antenna's** axis and hulled
down onto the straight run, so there is one continuous passage with no step
anywhere across it. `connector_passes` sweeps a 9.15mm plug gauge along that
path and must touch nothing; `connector_gauge_works` is its paired control,
an oversized gauge that must be caught. Swept by hand the passage clears
10.5mm and blocks at 11.0mm, so the connector has 1.35mm of margin.

Note for anyone tuning this: `-D` on the command line reaches `echo` but not
the CSG tree for these files, so a gauge sweep driven by `-D` silently
measures the file's own value at every step and reports that everything
passes. Edit the number instead.

### The antenna socket, and the lip that holds the base

The socket was Ø33 and a printed mount would not take the antenna at all: the
base is a flared cone slightly wider than that where it has to pass, so it
never got under the rim. It perched on top and tipped over — while the cable
underneath ran through perfectly, which is the part that had been checked.

Then the second printed one had its **rim snap off** while a base was being
levered under it, which says the approach was wrong and not just the number.
A 2mm chamfer left 2.5mm of wall at the edge, and a printed rim that thin,
pried outwards across its layer lines, is weak. Stiffness goes as thickness
cubed, so the barrel went 45 → 48 and the chamfer 2 → 1.2mm: 4.8mm of wall at
the edge, roughly seven times stiffer.

The deeper point is that **the base is held by depth, not by an overhang**.
The socket is 8mm deep, the antenna sits down inside it, and the chamfer is a
lead-in for a base that is already smaller than the hole — not a ramp for
forcing an oversized one past. If it has to be levered, the socket is too
small; make it bigger rather than pushing harder.

### What was actually stopping it, after three wrong guesses

The base measures **31.25mm across its flared bottom**, and **the lead leaves
the SIDE of the base 7.98mm above it** — both measured. The original socket was
Ø33, already 1.75mm of clearance, so *the bore was never what stopped it*, and
three attempts to fix the bore were fixing the wrong thing: that the base was
wider than the hole, that it was a cone flaring above a narrow bottom, that
the connector needed room beneath. None of them were true.

With the base seated, the lead is 7.98mm above the socket floor — and it
cannot go down through that floor, because the base is sitting on it. It has
to leave sideways. The printed mount gave it nowhere to go, so the connector
ended up jammed in the notch where the cable passage happens to break through
the wall, holding the base up at an angle. That notch was an accident of the
geometry; there is now a deliberate slot, 7mm wide, running from the floor up
past the rim.

It faces local +Y in the antenna's frame, which works out to world
(0, +0.309, −0.951) — down and back toward the plate — so the lead drops
straight into the passage that was already there instead of being led around
the barrel. `cable_slot_open` checks a rod at the measured exit height passes
out through the wall, and `cable_slot_other_side` is its control: the same rod
on the far side must be blocked, or "the slot is open" would be
indistinguishable from "the probe missed the mount".

`socket_takes_base` holds it, with `socket_gauge_works` as its paired control.
Its first version was wrong in a way worth recording: it ran a full-diameter
disc 12mm into the air above the mouth and failed at 283mm³, which was the
arm alongside. A 35mm cylinder held 12mm above the socket really does overlap
the arm — and means nothing, because the base is a cone that narrows and comes
in from outside. The question is whether the base fits the socket.

## Two antenna mounts, and which to print

`antenna_mount` holds the antenna itself: a 33mm socket cut around the
FlightAware desktop puck's 31.25mm base, with a slot for the lead that leaves
the side 7.98mm up. It fits that antenna beautifully and nothing else, which
makes the case choose the antenna.

`antenna_mount_sma` inverts that. Same flange, same three bolts into the same
inserts, same counter-tilt -- only the far end changes, to a panel-mount SMA
jack. Anything with an SMA plug now works: the same puck, a tuned whip
standing straight off the back, or coax running to an antenna somewhere with
a view of the sky. Swapping it is three screws; the back plate and both
shells are untouched.

Print the SMA one unless you specifically want the puck held on the case.
Measured on this hardware, an indoor puck saw **1 aircraft** while a properly
sited antenna saw **14 of the same sky at the same moment** -- so the ability
to put the antenna somewhere else is worth more than any mount that holds it
here.

The counter-tilt is the part not to touch. ADS-B is vertically polarised, and
`ant_axis_frame()` is what keeps the jack vertical while the case leans back
18 degrees in its cradle.

Four things are checked rather than assumed, and the interesting one is
`sma_passage_joins`: the cavity behind the jack has to actually meet the
cable bore, or the jack threads into a sealed pocket and the coax has nowhere
to go. That failure is invisible in preview -- both volumes are cut, the part
looks hollow, and the wall between them only exists in the print.
