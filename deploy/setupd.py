"""Root helper for the StratoScan setup server.

This is the privilege boundary. The HTTP server (setup-server.py) runs
unprivileged and cannot touch the system directly; it asks this process to
perform a fixed set of verbs over a unix socket. The HTTP parser is the part
most likely to be attacked and is therefore exactly the part that must not be
root.

Design rules, all of which exist because breaking them strands or exposes the
appliance:

  * Closed verb enum. There is no generic "run nmcli" or "run systemctl"
    passthrough, so a compromised web tier cannot escalate to arbitrary
    commands -- only to the specific, validated operations below.
  * Every parameter is re-validated HERE, not merely in the caller. The web
    tier's validation is a UX convenience; this is the security control.
  * No shell, ever. subprocess with an argv list, absolute paths, a fixed
    minimal environment, and an explicit timeout.
  * Secrets (WiFi PSK, Tailscale auth key) never appear in argv, where any
    local user could read them from /proc, nor in the journal. They are
    passed through 0600 files on tmpfs that are unlinked immediately.
  * Every state write is atomic and fsynced, including the directory entry.
    A power cut mid-write must never leave a half-written config that stops
    the device booting onto the network.
  * Network changes are add-then-switch with an armed rollback. The working
    profile is never edited or deleted; a new candidate profile is created
    with autoconnect off and only promoted once connectivity is proven.

    2. THE RUNNING REGULATORY DOMAIN DOES NOT CHANGE. The Pi's Broadcom radio
       registers a custom regulatory table (phy#0 reports country 99), so the
       driver overrides `iw reg set` and the global domain reads 98 rather
