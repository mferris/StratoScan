"""Keeps a StratoScan unit reachable no matter what.

Runs every couple of minutes and at boot. It is also the one root process on
a timer that updates can reach, so it carries the last-resort health checks
too -- see check_health() -- which a unit ten years into someone else's house
has no other way to get. Networking jobs:

1. RECONCILE an unconfirmed network change. setupd writes pending.json
   (fsynced) before it touches the radio and deletes it on confirm. If a
   pending record is still here, the change was never confirmed -- the new
   network did not work, or the power was cut mid-change -- so it is rolled
   back unconditionally. Without this, a reboot at the wrong moment leaves
   the device on a network that does not work, with no way in.

2. FALL BACK TO A HOTSPOT. If the device has no usable connection, raise
   'StratoScan-Setup' so someone with a phone can reach the setup page.
   This is the entire first-run story for a recipient: a device fresh out of
   the box has no credentials for their WiFi and they have no SSH.

The hotspot ALTERNATES rather than latching: concurrent AP+STA is unreliable
on this chipset, and a unit that camps in AP mode after a brief router
reboot never rejoins on its own. So it retries the real networks between AP
periods.
