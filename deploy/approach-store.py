"""
Local-only (127.0.0.1) shared store for RDU approach-track points.

index.html's client-side tracking (updateApproachTracking() / confirmApproachOnDrop()
in index.html) buffers candidate positions per-aircraft and, once a landing is
confirmed, commits them here instead of to browser localStorage -- localStorage
is scoped per-browser/per-device, so the kiosk's own accumulated picture would
never be visible to anyone checking in from a separate browser (their laptop,
phone, the Funnel URL). This service gives every viewer the same shared,
growing picture. lighttpd proxies /approaches requests to it (see
91-stratoscan-approach-store.conf), keeping the browser's fetch same-origin.

GET  /approaches  -> current accumulated points, as a JSON array of [lon, lat] pairs
POST /approaches  -> append points (JSON array of [lon, lat] pairs in the body);
                     capped at MAX_POINTS total, oldest evicted first

Multiple viewers (kiosk + anyone else with the page open) each independently
detect and report landings they observe -- there's no leader election, so the
same real landing could get reported more than once if two browsers are open
at the same time. Harmless: it just means that landing's path is
over-represented by a point or two in the accumulated picture, not wrong.
