"""
Local-only (127.0.0.1) endpoint that powers the kiosk display back on.

The screensaver (deploy/stratoscan-screensaver.service) uses swayidle +
wlopm to genuinely power the panel off when idle -- the only real "off"
available, since this Pi exposes no backlight control. Touch wakes it,
because touch is ordinary compositor input. An *alert*, though, happens
inside the browser, which has no way to reach the compositor. This is that
way: index.html POSTs /wake when an alert fires and "Alerts wake the
screen" is on (see wakeScreenForAlert), and lighttpd proxies it here
(95-stratoscan-wake.conf).

Runs as a --user service, unlike the other stores here: it needs the
session's WAYLAND_DISPLAY to talk to the compositor at all, which a
DynamicUser system service cannot have.

POST /wake       -> powers the output on; 204 on success.
POST /wake/alive -> the radar reporting that it just painted a frame. See
                    the watchdog below for why anything cares.

After waking we also restart the screensaver unit. swayidle fires its
`timeout` action once per idle period, so without this the display would
stay on indefinitely after an alert -- there is no further input to trigger
`resume` and re-arm it. Restarting resets the countdown, so the screen
blanks again IDLE_MINUTES after the alert, which is the behaviour you'd
expect.

# same error 345,000 times over 50 minutes, and the radar sat frozen with
# stale traffic on screen while the receiver underneath was perfectly
# healthy. Only someone walking up to it noticed.

# actually failed, and cannot be inferred from outside: index.html posts here
# from inside its render loop, after a frame is genuinely drawn.
#
# The display being powered off is NOT a fault. The screensaver blanks the
# panel, and a hidden page legitimately stops receiving animation frames --
# so the heartbeat stops too, and treating that as a freeze would reboot the
# radar every night. wlopm reports the real power state, and the watchdog
# only acts while the panel is on.

# before a restart -- no black screen, no risk of coming back windowed.
#
# It is a FILE rather than an HTTP call so nothing new listens on the network:
# only a local process running as this user can request a reload, and the flag
# is delivered on the heartbeat the page already sends every 20 seconds.
# The updater watches this file to decide whether a new build actually
# renders. It is touched on every heartbeat, so its mtime is "the display
# painted a frame at least this recently" -- the same signal the frozen-display
# watchdog uses, reused so an update that blanks the screen is caught by the
# thing already watching the screen.

# writable the moment the root helper was restarted, and this service, which
# runs as the desktop user, silently could not write it again.
