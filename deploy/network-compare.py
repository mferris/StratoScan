"""
Local-only (127.0.0.1) proxy that compares this receiver against a public
ADS-B network, and keeps a running scorecard of how the two differ.

Why a device-side service rather than fetching from the page:

  - Same origin. The page is served from http://localhost, so a direct
    call to another host is a cross-origin request the API need not allow.
  - One upstream call no matter how many people are looking. The kiosk,
    a laptop and the public Funnel URL all share the same cached answer,
    so a community-run service does not get hit once per viewer.
  - The receiver's exact position never leaves the network. The query is
    built from coordinates ROUNDED to 2dp (~1.1km), the same precision
    funnel-gateway.py already exposes publicly. Sending survey-precision
    coordinates to a third party to ask "what is near me" would undo the
    rounding the rest of this project does deliberately.

Nothing here runs on its own. The scorecard accumulates only from
requests the page makes, and the page only makes them when the
"Network comparison" setting is on -- which is ON by default
(DEFAULT_ALERT_SETTINGS in index.html). Turning it off stops all contact.

GET /network      -> {"ac": [...], "stats": {...}, "source": ..., "fetched": age_s}
GET /network/stats -> just the scorecard, no upstream call
