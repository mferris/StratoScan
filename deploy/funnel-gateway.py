"""
Local-only reverse proxy sitting between Tailscale Funnel and lighttpd.

Funnel makes whatever it points at reachable by anyone on the public
internet, unauthenticated -- lighttpd (127.0.0.1:80) also serves the LAN
and the kiosk itself, which both legitimately need exact data (readsb's own
signal-range/MLAT math depends on the real configured position; nothing
about that changes here). This gateway is what Funnel is pointed at instead
of lighttpd directly, so only the copy that actually leaves the house over
the public internet gets filtered -- LAN/kiosk traffic never touches this
process at all.

Every request is proxied through unchanged except one: GET
/tar1090/data/receiver.json (readsb's own receiver-location endpoint, which
index.html's loadHome() fetches to auto-center the radar) has its lat/lon
rounded to 2 decimal places -- about 0.7 miles of fuzz, plenty to keep the
map/radar centered correctly at the app's actual range scale, but no longer
a literal street address to anyone who curls the Funnel URL.

# How many people look at this radar's public page, for its owner. Counts,
# not tracking: no cookies, nothing written about any one visitor.
#
# * Unique visitors in a day: each page load's address and browser are hashed
#   with a random salt made fresh each day and kept only in memory, and the
#   hashes are held in memory only until midnight. What is saved is counts.
#   Yesterday's hashes can't be linked to today's or turned back into an
#   address, because the salt that made them is gone.
# * The address is the LAST entry of X-Forwarded-For: the one Tailscale's
#   proxy adds. Earlier entries are whatever the client sent. Without the
#   header at all, unique visitors aren't counted, only page views, and the
#   summary says so ("basis").
# * The owner's own app, away from home, sends X-StratoScan-App and is
#   counted apart: minutes it was in use, not visits.
# * Only page loads count, not the page's own polling once it is open.
#   Obvious robots (crawlers, link previews, curl) are counted as robots.
#
# Saved to VISITS_DIR (the service's StateDirectory) every few minutes, and

# predates this, until the installer is re-run -- the counts live in memory
