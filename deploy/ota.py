"""Over-the-air updates: check, verify, apply, and roll back on its own.

The reason this is safe enough to put on a device in somebody else's house is
not the download. It is three things that happen around it:

  1. NOTHING IS TRUSTED WITHOUT A SIGNATURE. The manifest must carry an ssh
     signature from the key in /opt/stratoscan/allowed_signers, which was put
     there before the unit shipped. GitHub is delivery, not trust: a
     compromised account could publish a release but could not sign one.

  2. THE SERIAL MUST INCREASE. An old release stays correctly signed forever,
     so without this a device could be walked backwards onto a version whose
     bugs are already fixed.

  3. A BAD UPDATE UNDOES ITSELF. After applying, the display has to paint a
     frame within PAINT_TIMEOUT_S or the previous files go back and the kiosk
     restarts again. The heartbeat that proves this already exists -- it is
     what the frozen-display watchdog uses -- so an update that blanks the
     screen is caught by the thing already watching the screen, with nobody
     in the room.

  4. A RELEASE REACHES UNITS IN RINGS (performance audit, 2026-10-09). The
     release carries a signed rollout policy saying how far it may go -- ring
     0 is the maintainer's own radar, 1 family, 2 early adopters, 3 everyone
     -- and a unit installs it only when its own ring (RING_FILE) is within
     that. The maintainer widens the policy after the canary has run it;
     pausing it stops the spread. A unit that already has it keeps it: there
     is no downgrade (point 2), a fix is the next release. Without a policy
     a release goes nowhere, so a hand-made one cannot reach every unit at
     once by accident.

Usage:  ota.py check         look for a newer release, verify it, stage nothing
        ota.py stage         download and verify into the staging directory
        ota.py apply         install what is staged, verify paint, roll back
        ota.py status        print what is installed and what is available
        --ignore-rollout     (check/stage/apply) take a release the rollout
                             policy holds back from this unit; for a hand on
                             the unit, never for the timer

# Static web assets -- audio for the sound themes, so far -- get a narrower
# rule than DEPLOY_ALLOWED's per-file list, because they are a different kind
# of thing: browser-sandboxed content with no more privilege than index.html
# already has, not code a service runs as root. Matched by extension rather
# than by name, so adding a fifth sound later is dropping a file in sounds/,
# not also a change here -- the DEPLOY_ALLOWED list is deliberately the
# opposite of this because each entry there IS a decision to make.
#
# WIDENING THIS RULE HAS A ONE-RELEASE LAG, and it is worth understanding once
# rather than re-diagnosing it from a symptom. apply() is a single process
# invocation of the ota.py ALREADY ON DISK -- the copy from the PREVIOUS
# install. If a release both widens dest_for() (or DEPLOY_ALLOWED) AND ships
# files that need the wider rule to be installed, this run's dest_for() is
# still the OLD one: it does not know the new rule exists, silently skips
# those files (dest_for returning None is not an error, just a `continue`),
# and only THEN writes the new ota.py to disk -- too late to change what this
# run decided, because Python already has the old module loaded.
#
# This happened for real the day sounds/ shipped: staged 55 files, wrote 15,
# no error anywhere, state=ok. The four .ogg files were downloaded and hash-
# verified correctly; they were just invisible to the dest_for() that was
# still running. The fix was not a bug fix -- it was a second release, which
# ran with the now-current ota.py and installed them. A release that
# introduces a new install rule and a file that needs it should assume that
# file arrives one release later, or plan to cut a trivial follow-up.
