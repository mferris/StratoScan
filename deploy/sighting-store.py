"""
Local-only (127.0.0.1) shared store for this receiver's flight history.

Tracks, per hex: how many distinct times this receiver has picked the
aircraft up (`t`), how many distinct times it came within the nearby-alert
radius (`n`, see ALERT_RADIUS_NM in index.html), and how many distinct times
it was seen only via the network comparison and not heard here at all (`g`).
Increments are driven client-side at the same "this is a new visit" moments
the rest of index.html already detects, not once per poll. Persisted
server-side rather than in localStorage, so the kiosk's own accumulated
history is visible to every viewer (laptop, phone, the Funnel URL), not just
whichever browser happened to be open when a plane flew by. lighttpd proxies
/sightings requests here (see 93-stratoscan-sighting-store.conf).

Alongside the counts each aircraft carries a classification -- operator class
(commercial / private / military) and airframe kind (jet / heavy / prop /
helicopter / lighter-than-air) -- so the Statistics screens can answer "what
actually flies over this house" rather than only "how many". The classifying
happens on the page, where the type database and the callsign are already
resolved; this end only stores and aggregates what it is told.

  GET  /sightings        -> {"<hex>": {"total": N, "nearby": M}, ...}
                            The original shape, kept exactly: it is what the
                            radar reads on load to fill in per-plane counts,
                            and an older cached page must keep working.
  GET  /sightings/stats  -> the aggregate the Statistics screens render,
                            including hour-of-day and day-of-week histograms
                            of when aircraft actually arrive overhead.
  GET  /sightings/unclassified
                         -> {"hexes": [...]} -- aircraft with no airframe
                            recorded yet. The page can work out an airframe
                            from the hex alone (it has the type database that
                            the radar draws blip shapes from), so this is what
                            lets a history collected before classification
                            existed be filled in rather than written off.
  POST /sightings        -> body {"hex": "..."} plus any of:
                              "kind":  "total" | "nearby" | "network"
                                       -- increments that counter by one
                              "class": {"op": ..., "k": ..., "cs": ...}
                                       -- sets the aircraft's classification
                              "rec":   {"far": nm, "near": nm,
                                        "high": ft, "fast": kt}
                                       -- offers a value for each all-time
                                          record; kept only if it beats the
                                          standing one
                            Returns the updated {"total": N, "nearby": M}.
                         -> or body {"batch": [{"hex": ..., "class": {...}}, ...]}
                            to classify many at once.

The store lives in memory and is written to disk at most every
FLUSH_INTERVAL seconds, plus on shutdown. It used to be re-read and rewritten
whole on every POST: measured on the RDU unit, 3.5 GB written in 17 hours
from a file under 1 MB. At the MAX_HEXES ceiling on a busy site (SFO,
Schiphol) that pattern reaches ~100 GB/day -- a consumer SD card's whole
endurance in a year or two. The cost of batching is at most FLUSH_INTERVAL of
counts lost on a power cut, which is noise against years of history.

Multiple viewers open at once each independently detect and report the same
real sighting -- same accepted tradeoff as approach-store.py: harmless
over-counting by a point or two, not wrong. Records are the exception and
need no such tolerance: they are compare-and-keep, so the same record
offered by four viewers still lands once.
