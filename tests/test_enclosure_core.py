"""The two enclosures must be one case design wearing two costumes.

There are two .scad files -- a retro radar and a kitten -- and only their
exteriors are supposed to differ. Everything a Pi, a display, two speakers, a
fan and an antenna actually bolt to has to stay one part, or a spare back
plate printed for one unit will not fit the other and every future fix has to
be made twice (and, in practice, will be made once).

Drift here is silent. Nothing about the two files being wrong looks wrong:
both still render, both still pass their own checks.scad suite, and the
divergence only shows up when a part is in your hand. That happened -- the
kitten's exhaust slots were upgraded to 12mm rounded stadium slots and the
retro was left on the old flat rectangles, for long enough that the retro
still defined exhaust_slot_h = 12 without ever using it.
