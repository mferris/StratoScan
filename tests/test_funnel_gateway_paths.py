"""Regression test for the Funnel gateway's local-only path filter.

This exists because the original filter compared the RAW request path, and
three bypasses were live-exploitable against the deployed device: /./wake,
/x/../wake and /%77ake all returned 204 (the endpoint powering on the
display) instead of 404, reachable by anyone holding the public Funnel URL.

lighttpd percent-decodes and collapses traversal before routing, so the
gateway must normalise to the same form the upstream will act on BEFORE
deciding. Run: python3 tests/test_funnel_gateway_paths.py
